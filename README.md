## Tables

**tables.jsonl**: store the table information, and every line(table) is a json format object. `header` means the column names, `types` means the types inherited from [WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL), `id` indicates the table ids origination in WikiSQL, `rows` are the values of whole table. A line looks like the following:

```json
{
	"header": [
		"Date",

		"Venue",
		"Result",
		"Attendance",
		"Competition"
	],
	"page_title": "2007–08 Guildford Flames season",

		"real",

	"page_id": 15213262,
	"id": [
		"2-15213262-12",
		"2-15213262-7"
	],
	"section_title": "March",

## Content

**train.tsv** and **test.tsv**: train/test split of FollowUp Dataset. Every line is a tuple of format (Precendent Query, Follow-up Query, Fused Query, Table ID), where the *Table ID* is **line index** starting from 1 in `tables.jsonl`. Split symbol is TAB(\t). A line looks like the following:

```tsv

```
